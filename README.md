# WhatToEat

## Milestone
### Basic App (1-2 weeks)
The basic app should contain the following functions:
* A basic UI
  - A list showing available restaurants / eating options 
  - A start button
  - An area showing the final result
  - A button for re-selection
  
 * A simple recommendation algorithm
  - For example random selection
  
### A more functional App (1-2 weeks)
From the basic App we extend to a more functional and usable one, which, in a sense, can already be considered handy and useful. Users can use the App to first decide which cuisine type to eat, then decide which restaurant to go for. 
* Constraints
  - Add constraints to the recommendation such as the type of the food (Japanese, Italian, Fast food...etc) and the price range.
* A more user-friendly UI
  - A welcome page when the App is loading
  - Buttons for users to set constraints
  - Enable user to enter personal information
  
### Adding database to store user information (2-3 weeks)

### Integrate third party API for retriving location and restaurant information (2-3 weeks)
